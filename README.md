Notes

# Terminal 1 (in worker directory)
npx wrangler dev

# Terminal 2 (in admin directory)
npm run dev

# Terminal 3 (in blog directory)
npm run dev

## Database Management

### Setup and Migrations
The project uses Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) for the database. All database changes are managed through migrations in the `worker/migrations/sql` directory.

```bash
# Create a new D1 database
npx wrangler d1 create cms-db

# Run all migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Reset database (WARNING: This will delete all data)
npm run db:reset

# Blow up the database (WARNING: This will delete all data)
npx wrangler d1 execute cms-db --local --file=/Users/jt/cloudflare-cms/worker/migrations/sql/0000_initial.sql
```

### Database Structure
The database consists of several core tables:

1. `site_config`
   - Stores site-wide configuration
   - Contains title, description, and navigation settings
   - Default values are set in initial migration

2. `posts`
   - Blog post content and metadata
   - Includes title, content, slug, and publishing status
   - Indexed for efficient querying

3. `media`
   - Tracks uploaded files and their metadata
   - Links to R2 storage through r2_key
   - Includes file information like size and mime type

4. `_migrations`
   - Tracks which migrations have been applied
   - Prevents duplicate migrations

### Debugging Database
```bash
# View current database state
curl http://localhost:8787/api/debug/db

# Check specific table contents
npx wrangler d1 execute cms-db --local --command="SELECT * FROM site_config;"
```

### Creating New Migrations
1. Create a new SQL file in `worker/migrations/sql`
2. Name it with sequential numbering (e.g., `0001_add_new_field.sql`)
3. Include both up and down migrations if possible
4. Run migration with:
```bash
npx wrangler d1 execute cms-db --local --file=./migrations/sql/your_migration.sql
```

is this right?
  router.delete('/api/media/:id', async (request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext, params: Record<string, string>) => {
    return deleteMedia(request, env, params.id);
  });


  That clean up script i had to add to the index.ts file to get rid of the duplicate files.
    // Add this temporarily for cleanup
  router.post('/api/debug/cleanup', async (request: Request, env: Env) => {
    try {
      console.log('🧹 Starting cleanup...');
      
      // Get all files from database
      const { results: dbFiles } = await env.DB.prepare(`
        SELECT * FROM media
      `).all();
      
      console.log('📊 Files in database:', dbFiles);
      
      // List all files in R2
      const r2List = await env.MEDIA_BUCKET.list();
      console.log('📦 Files in R2:', r2List.objects);
      
      // Delete the problematic file from both places
      await env.DB.prepare(`
        DELETE FROM media 
        WHERE r2_key LIKE '%c9675786-a03a-4812-8415-fef038877a7c%'
      `).run();
      
      try {
        await env.MEDIA_BUCKET.delete('c9675786-a03a-4812-8415-fef038877a7c-Bouy_4 Transparent.png');
      } catch (e) {
        console.log('R2 delete error (expected if file already gone):', e);
      }
      
      return new Response(JSON.stringify({
        message: 'Cleanup completed',
        dbFiles,
        r2Files: r2List.objects
      }), {
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
      });
      
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Cleanup error:', error);
      return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: 'Cleanup failed' }), { 
        status: 500,
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
      });
    }
  });


  reset the database with ``npm run db:reset`` >> warning! this will delete all the data in the database.

### Best Practices
- Never modify existing migrations
- Create new migrations for schema changes
- Include meaningful migration names
- Test migrations locally before deployment
- Back up data before running migrations in production

Websockets


automatic Logout upon 401 error in the admin panel. 
back button in admin panel posts page. 
Center text within blog post rowes on the table in the posts admin panel. 
A full markdown text post showing what's possible in the admin panel. 
Markdown editor component in the admin panel. 


What next?
I think we can do all the pages that don't get updated regularly in the site_config dashboard of the admin panel. 
This means adding to the database 
   Booolean (1/0) for whether an image tagline is displayed in Pics
   Description of each image that can be used for SEO but not displayed in the Pics page unless the boolean is 1
   Description of pics page (replaces "just some random photos. taken on pixel 8, pixel 5a, pixel 2.")
   Description in about page (replaces "hey there! i'm a student in seattle who goes by the name refact0r online. i'm interested in comp sci, web dev, design, among other topics. i'm passionate about building websites and apps that are both functional and beautiful.")

Creating these database tables and API endpoints
Setting up the store to handle these new data types
3. Creating the admin UI components
Updating the blog frontend
Or would you prefer to see the complete plan first? Let me know which approach you'd prefer and we can proceed step by step.
The advantage of doing all pages together is:
Single database migration
Consistent API pattern
Reusable admin components
Single store update
One-time testing of the full flow
Would you like to proceed with the database/API layer first?
encrypt the websocket connections
how is he doing this: https://us.umami.is/share/HwZnyuHQ5Rqz3NWf/refact0r.dev

for colors, if we could have a color selector and have the user pick their favorite colors, this coulld be very cool.
