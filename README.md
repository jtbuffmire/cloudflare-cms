Notes

# Terminal 1 (in worker directory)
npx wrangler dev

# Terminal 2 (in admin directory)
npm run dev

# Terminal 3 (in blog directory)
npm run dev

## Database Management

### Setup and Migrations
The project uses Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) for the database. All database changes are managed through migrations in the `worker/migrations/sql` directory.

```bash
# Create a new D1 database
npx wrangler d1 create cms-db

# Run all migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Reset database (WARNING: This will delete all data)
npm run db:reset

# Blow up the database (WARNING: This will delete all data)
npx wrangler d1 execute cms-db --local --file=/Users/jt/cloudflare-cms/worker/migrations/sql/0000_initial.sql
```

### Database Structure
The database consists of several core tables:

1. `site_config`
   - Stores site-wide configuration
   - Contains title, description, and navigation settings
   - Default values are set in initial migration

2. `posts`
   - Blog post content and metadata
   - Includes title, content, slug, and publishing status
   - Indexed for efficient querying

3. `media`
   - Tracks uploaded files and their metadata
   - Links to R2 storage through r2_key
   - Includes file information like size and mime type

4. `_migrations`
   - Tracks which migrations have been applied
   - Prevents duplicate migrations

### Debugging Database
```bash
# View current database state
curl http://localhost:8787/api/debug/db

# Check specific table contents
npx wrangler d1 execute cms-db --local --command="SELECT * FROM site_config;"
```

### Creating New Migrations
1. Create a new SQL file in `worker/migrations/sql`
2. Name it with sequential numbering (e.g., `0001_add_new_field.sql`)
3. Include both up and down migrations if possible
4. Run migration with:
```bash
npx wrangler d1 execute cms-db --local --file=./migrations/sql/your_migration.sql
```

Project: Cloudflare CMS

Key Components:
1. Media Management
   - R2 Storage for files
   - D1 Database for metadata
   - CRUD operations implemented
   - Recently fixed delete functionality using r2_key

2. Authentication
   - JWT-based auth

is this right?
  router.delete('/api/media/:id', async (request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext, params: Record<string, string>) => {
    return deleteMedia(request, env, params.id);
  });


  That clean up script i had to add to the index.ts file to get rid of the duplicate files.
    // Add this temporarily for cleanup
  router.post('/api/debug/cleanup', async (request: Request, env: Env) => {
    try {
      console.log('🧹 Starting cleanup...');
      
      // Get all files from database
      const { results: dbFiles } = await env.DB.prepare(`
        SELECT * FROM media
      `).all();
      
      console.log('📊 Files in database:', dbFiles);
      
      // List all files in R2
      const r2List = await env.MEDIA_BUCKET.list();
      console.log('📦 Files in R2:', r2List.objects);
      
      // Delete the problematic file from both places
      await env.DB.prepare(`
        DELETE FROM media 
        WHERE r2_key LIKE '%c9675786-a03a-4812-8415-fef038877a7c%'
      `).run();
      
      try {
        await env.MEDIA_BUCKET.delete('c9675786-a03a-4812-8415-fef038877a7c-Bouy_4 Transparent.png');
      } catch (e) {
        console.log('R2 delete error (expected if file already gone):', e);
      }
      
      return new Response(JSON.stringify({
        message: 'Cleanup completed',
        dbFiles,
        r2Files: r2List.objects
      }), {
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
      });
      
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Cleanup error:', error);
      return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: 'Cleanup failed' }), { 
        status: 500,
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
      });
    }
  });


  reset the database with ``npm run db:reset`` >> warning! this will delete all the data in the database.

```

### Best Practices
- Never modify existing migrations
- Create new migrations for schema changes
- Include meaningful migration names
- Test migrations locally before deployment
- Back up data before running migrations in production

Questions.
Blog Integration - should I maintain compatibility with existing file-based posts, and if so, how would a user be able to upload a file-based post?

Next Steps
CMS Admin Panel Updates
Add a markdown editor component (like CodeMirror or Monaco)
Add image upload functionality
Add preview functionality
Support for frontmatter (metadata)
Worker API Changes
Expand post schema to include markdown content
Add image upload/storage endpoints
Add image serving endpoints
Update post CRUD operations
Storage Requirements
Image storage solution (R2 or similar)
Content storage updates (D1 schema changes)
Blog Integration
Update post rendering to handle markdown
Update image handling
Maintain compatibility with existing file-based posts

Storage Layer (First)
- Add preview endpoint
a. Update D1 Schema
- Add markdown content field
- Add metadata fields for images
- Update migrations

b. Set up R2 Storage
- Configure R2 bucket
- Set up image upload/delete functions
- Add image URL generation

API Layer (Second)
a. Update Post Endpoints
- Modify POST/PUT to handle markdown
- Add image upload endpoint
- Add image serving endpoint
- Add image deletion endpoint

b. Add Preview Functionality
- Add markdown-to-html conversion
- Add preview endpoint


looking at migrate.js and package.json, is this activated with npx migrate?


Great. Next let's turn our attention to the R2 Storage
- Configure R2 bucket
- Set up image upload/delete functions
- Add image URL generation
